### General Info
***
This a simple VR game in which you control a little spaceship, moving it around with your hand, shooting at asteroids and getting new high records.
After creating an account, you'll be able to play the game, upload your records and use the web to customize your profile, see your stats and the global ranking.

The web and the game are still a Work In Progress.
